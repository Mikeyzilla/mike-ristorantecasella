Hello! This is Mike. This app is in progress, meaning that it's not currently 100% done. I will get back to working on it, but it's not finished yet. The "yet to be done" features are included in the Known Issues file. I still need to implement payment info and test that out on the frontend - a checkout system after ordering food. After that, I think the MVP will be done, but I most likely will revisit this in the future to update it as it's a personal favorite. There are a couple things to note, firstly that AI was used in helping me write some of the code for this app. Before this project, I knew React and was proficient in React, but there were some things that I wanted to hone in on and perfect / address any discrepancies in my logic and fundamental understanding. The result is that not only did I learn what I needed in this project, but I can replicate any of the code here and I understand exactly what to do next time. 

In order to run this app, you will need a few things. Firstly, you will need to make a DB that meets all of the requirements and establish connection to it in the backend server. Then, because it requires JWT, you will need to make a JWT secret code.
