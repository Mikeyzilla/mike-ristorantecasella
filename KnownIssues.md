Known Issues:

A) No overflow in Registration - cannot see the bottom of the page.

B) In order online, the bill is too close to the menu items, push it further right.

C) In View Menu, everything should fit on the same page. Scale down the size of all items proportionally until it does.

D) In About Us, everything needs to be pushed to the left a bit. You can't fully see what's on the page as everything is overflowing on the right.

E) In Registration, the space between Join our Family and Sign Up Now should be less. They should be closer together.

F) Examine all code to make sure I understand it thoroughly - there may be AI code I don't understand. Make sure to really understand and remember React.
