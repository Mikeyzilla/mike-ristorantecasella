Known Issues:

A) In View Menu, everything should fit on the same page. Scale down the size of all items proportionally until it does.

B) Examine all code to make sure I understand it thoroughly - especially the backend server and Order Online. Try to "redo" them from scratch to see if I can understand. Test all code out to see if it works as intended and if any new features need to be added.
